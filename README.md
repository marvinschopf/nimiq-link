# nimiq-link
`nimiq-link` is a URL shortener developed with a special focus on the cryptocurrency NIMIQ.

The main instance of `nimiq-link` is accessible at **[nimiq.link](https://nimiq.link)**.

However, this URL shortener takes a different course and does not mine NIMIQ in the browsers of people who visit short links, but shows visitors a fact about NIMIQ for a few seconds, so that these people might be motivated to look into NIMIQ.

`nimiq-link` is a Next.js application that is written in TypeScript and uses Preact as React runtime. The underlying database is MySQL.
